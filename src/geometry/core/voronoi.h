4.1 VORONOI GEOMETRY
*/

/*
Voronoi vertex is the center of the sphere that passes
through the vertices of the Delaunay object.
The sphere center is the intersection of the perpendicular
bisectors.

Plane equation
(x - p) ⋅ n = 0
x ⋅ n = p ⋅ n

Plane equation for vertices v(0) and v(n), n >= 1, n <= N
n = v(n) - v(0)
p = (v(n) + v(0)) / 2
x ⋅ (v(n) - v(0)) = ((v(n) + v(0)) / 2) ⋅ (v(n) - v(0))
x ⋅ (2 * (v(n) - v(0))) = v(n) ⋅ v(n) - v(0) ⋅ v(0)
